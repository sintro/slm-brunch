## Slm-brunch

Adds [Slm](https://github.com/slm-lang/slm) templates support to [brunch](http://brunch.io). The Slm template engine is Node.js version of Ruby\`s Slim.

This plugin can make only static assets compiling for now  (which are in app/assets). Just make valid slim-templates, call it "something**.slim**" or "something**.slm**" and it will be compiled at /public. Of course, there is no sence in trying to embed any locals output in templates, because it is static pages, but it is possible to make a kind of "global" variables for this plugin in its config, which can be rendered in static html pages using Slim syntax (soon). 

There is possibility to use special attributes from Angular2 HTML templates (like `[(ngModel)]="..."` or `#local_variable`) in this plugin\`s Slm engine\`s fork (made by me also). There ase some changes in parsing regexp, which can break or limit the native engine\`s functionality in *rare* cases (and every of them can be avoided easily by using different syntax constructions). Everything is noted in fork\`s README here: https://github.com/sintro/slm.git


Static compilation example:

Put your static content into app/assets/your_name.hbs.

Content of file your_name.slm

```html
h1 = this.title
```

In config define locals.
```javascript
  plugins: {
    slm: {
      locals: {
        title: 'slm-brunch'
      }
    }
  }
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add some typical config options (files patterns, global locals, etc)
- [ ] Check hot-reloading (probably does not work now)
- [x] Add the possibility of getting pretty HTMLs
- [x] Add angular2 templates support
- [ ] Add js-templates compiling support
- [ ] Or even some direct integration with Slm-lang (without prerendering)? Dont know now if it makes sence
- [ ] Add tests?
- [ ] Publish in NPM 

## Installation

Add `"slm-brunch": "x.y.z"` to `package.json` of your brunch app **(not published on npm now!)**.

If you want to use git version of plugin, add
`"slm-brunch": "git+https://github.com/sintro/slm-brunch.git"`.

## Work progress

I did this early release just to get some help from community on implementing of Slm integration into Brunch. This plugin almost was not tested and refactored. See *Commits*

## Credits

Thanks to many other Brunch plugins for samples and sources ;)

## Commits

Feel free to make forks and PRs, I think many of current TODOs can be solved really easy by you!
